# ecommerce_product_range_analysis

<b>Project Brief</b>
Everything Plus, an online store that sells household goods who would like to utilize their data to better understand their product range.<br>
The product manager wants to know which products are the winner and which ones are not selling well.<br>
By knowing this, the manager could plans the better use of marketing as well as operational expenses.

The plan should boost the company's revenue and reduce cost by:
- Optimizing the ads budget to the winning products to boost company's sales.
- Reducing storage and inventory handling expenses by knowing the quantity of stocks the company needs to hold and the reorder point when the company needs to replenish their stocks.
- Also reducing the storage cost by creating a promo or discount for items which don't sell well, so the items can get sold faster.
